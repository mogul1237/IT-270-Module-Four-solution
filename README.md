IT 270 Module Four Practicing HTML Table and Form Concepts
You have just finished the “HTML Tables” section of the “HTML Fundamentals” module on
Pluralsight.com—and hopefully followed along. These tutorials demonstrated how changes made to the
index and CSS files affect the website content that is rendered in a browser window.
In this two part exercise, you will begin with the index.html file in the Mod4-Act1 folder and the
index.html file in the Mod4-Act2 folder and add several additional pieces of content and styles, based on
your watching and understanding of the first seven videos of the “Styling Your HTML” section of the
“Front-End Web Development Quick Start with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript” module on Pluralsight.com.
